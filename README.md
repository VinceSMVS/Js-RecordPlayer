# Interactive Record Player

---

### My very first JavaScript project: a web-based interactive record player that brings music to life with dynamic visuals and track information.

This project features a simple, yet engaging interface where users can **select albums**, **play associated music tracks**, and view **real-time updates** to track information. The experience is enriched with a **visually spinning LP record** and **dynamic background color changes** that adapt to the mood of the music.

## Key Learning Outcomes & Features

As my initial foray into JavaScript, this project was fundamental in building my understanding of interactive web development. It provided hands-on experience with:

* **Fundamental JavaScript Concepts:** Implementing event listeners, manipulating the **DOM (Document Object Model)** to dynamically update content, and handling user interactions. This was crucial for functionalities like album selection and music playback control.
* **Audio Integration:** Working with the **HTML5 Audio API** to programmatically play and manage music files.
* **Dynamic Visual Feedback:** Creating engaging user experiences through **CSS transformations** for the spinning record effect and **JavaScript-driven background color changes** to reflect the music's ambiance. This taught me how to combine visual elements with functional behavior.
* **Project Structure:** Gaining an initial understanding of how to structure a JavaScript-driven web application.
